# Highlights
- Authors propose a self-supervised, deep convolutional neural network-based
strategy to perform the fiber clustering task in an anatomically informed
manner.
- Undesired fibers are rejected using soft label assignment probabilities.
- Multi-subject fiber cluster atlases can be created to be applied to new
subjects.


# Introduction

Tractography generates hundreds of thousands of fibers that are not immediately
useful to clinicians. Among others, fibers need to be clustered into
anatomically meaningful groups for such purpose. Conventional methods face a
number of challenges, including (i) long computation times; (ii) fiber point
ordering asymmetry; (iii) presence of outliers; (iV) a trade-off between
anatomical coherence and local fiber coordinate information; and (v)
inter-subject correspondence of fibers.

They propose to deal with these challenges using a self-supervised, anatomically
informed deep convolutional neural network-based model.


# Methods

Their method includes two stages:
- _A pre-training_ stage: a self-supervised learning strategy is adopted
with the pretext task of pairwise fiber distance prediction using embedded fiber
representations. A $$k$$-means clustering is performed to get initial clusters.
- A _clustering_ stage: a clustering layer is connected to the embedding layer
and generates soft label assignments, refining the clustering results of the
previous stage. A KL divergence loss and the prediction loss are combined to
optimize the neural network.

The fiber distances used in the pretext task are the MDF, which is not affected
by fibers whose point sequence is flipped[^1].

The fibers are represented as feature vectors (called _FiberMaps_) that combine
streamline vertices in both orientations following an earlier work from the same
authors[^2]. Fibers are dowsampled to 14 points to obtain the FiberMaps.

During inference, cluster assignments are obtained end-to-end on a new subject
without any $$k$$-means step.

The clustering stage is based on a modified version of the DCEC[^3] model in
order to incorporate the anatomical information. An additional term is added to
the soft assignment label (i.e. probability) that accounts for the Dice score
between the set of regions of a given fiber (according to an atlas) and the set
of regions of a given cluster. Additionally, fibers that have a soft label value
lower than a given threshold are removed (outlier rejection).

The total loss is the weighted sum of the terms of the two stages:

$$L = L_{p} + \lambda L_{c}$$

where $$L_{p} $$ is the distance prediction loss,
$$L_{c} = KL(P \mid\mid Q) = \sum_{i} \sum{j} p_{ij} \log \frac{p_{ij}}{q_{ij}}$$,
and $$\lambda$$ is a weighting term.

In the above equation,

$$p_{ij} = (q_{ij}^{2} / \sum_{i} q_{ij}) / (\sum_{j'} q_{ij'}^{2} / \sum_{i} q_{ij}))$$

where $$q_{ij}$$ the soft assignment label (that follows a Student's
t-distribution), i.e. the probability of assigning fiber $$i$$ to cluster $$j$$,
and is computed as:

$$q_{ij} = (1 + \lVert z_{i} - \mu_{j} \rVert^{2} * (1 - D_{ij}))^{-1} / (\sum_{j'} (1 + \lVert  z_{i} - \mu'_{j}  \rVert^{2} * (1 - D_{ij} 0 ))^{-1})$$

where $$z_{i}$$ is the embedding of fiber $$i$$; $$\mu_{j}$$ is the centroid
of cluster $$j$$; and $$D_{ij}$$ is the Dice score between the set of
(Freesurfer) regions of fiber $$i$$ and the set of Freesurfer regions of cluster
$$j$$.

During inference, a fiber $$i$$ is assigned to the cluster with the maximum
$$q_{ij}$$.


## Data

200 subjects of the HCP are used (split as 100/50/50 for
training/validation/testing).

For each training subject, 10000 random streamlines were selected, giving a
total size of 1M training streamlines. For validation and testing, whole-brain
tractography fibers (around 500k) were used.

Streamlines below 40 mm were discarded from the tractograms.

## Evaluation

Quality measures:

- Davies-Bouldin (DB) index:

$$DB = (1/n) \sum_{k=1}^{n} max_{x \neq y} \frac{\alpha_{i} + \alpha_{j}}{d(c_{i}, c_{j})}$$

where $$n$$ is the number of clusters, $$\alpha_{i}$$ and $$\alpha_{j}$$ are 
mean pairwise intra-cluster fiber distances, and $d(c_{i}, c_{j})$ is the
inter-cluster fiber distance between centroids $$c_{i}$$ and $$c_{j}$$ of
cluster $$i$$ and $$j$$. A smaller DB score indicates a better separation
between clusters.

- White Matter Parcellation Generalization (WMPG): represents the percentage of
clusters successfully detected across the testing subjects.

- Tract Anatomical Profile Coherence (TAPC): measures if the fibers within a
cluster $$c$$ commonly pass through the same brain anatomical regions:

$$TAPC(c) = (\sum_{f = 1}^{NF(c)} Dice(TAP(f), TAP_{atlas}(c)))/NF(c)$$

Higher TAPC scores indicate better anatomical coherence.

Baselines are QuickBundles[^1] and WMA[^2].
