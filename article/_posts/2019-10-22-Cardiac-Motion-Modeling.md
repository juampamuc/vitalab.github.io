# Highlights
- Unsupervised probabilistic motion model learned from image sequences
- Generative model using explicit time-dependent temporal convolutional networks trained with self-supervised temporal
  dropout sampling
- Demonstration of cardiac motion tracking, simulation, transport and temporal super-resolution


# Introduction


# Methods


## Data


# Results


# Conclusions

# Remarks
- The authors state that "for cyclic sequences, one could use a cyclic padding instead of zero-padding, for example by
  linking $$\tilde{z_t}$$ to $$\tilde{z_0}$$".
